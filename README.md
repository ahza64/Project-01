Probuidler: A simple way to track your project and members in motion


Here, you and your team members will be able to post, delete and update projects,
their descriptions, members and member tasks. You'll even be able to link a url
to an image to beautifully display your project in the background of the project's post. With very fast and easy implementation, we can alter the proBuilder to your companies theme.

To get this smooth running app deployed, I incorporated technologies such as:
-Express, NodeJS
-javaScript, jQuery
-AJAX, json
-mongoDB, mongoose
-handlebars
-and of course the ever pervasive HTML, CSS and bootstrap

The main features this app provides can be inducive to just about any multi-person
project. Here, you will be able to:
  -post new projects that include parameters
    -project name
    -owner/creator
    -lead
    -description
    -and even a way to place your own url for a background img
After the project is created, you can create members that can have:
  -member name
  -member task
the member tasks can be updated and individual projects and members can be removed.


In the near future authorization will be put in place, so only owners can create and delete projects and members.
